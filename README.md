Hi there 👋

I'm currently learning coding with The Odin Project. To be more specific I finished the foundations course and I'm now involved in the full stack java script course. 

Besides the curriculum I'm playing with a bunch of ideas I want to create with my growing skills.

I'm definitely looking for people in Denmark, who are also teaching themselves how to code. I'm based in Odense, so just write me, if you'd like to have a coffee together. Cause the much I love creating at the computer, I prefer an eye to eye talk over an online chat sometimes.

And most important, I'm looking for an INTERNSHIP. If you know someone who knows someone, who's looking for a curious and motivated developer-helper, write me.
